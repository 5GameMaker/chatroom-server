# About

Chatroom is free and open-source chat for, maybe, gamers, idk, doesn't really matter. We want
to implement features that no other app did, and do it in the best way possible. Unlike most
popular platform, we have no paid content (except if somebody actually will implement that on
their server), so you can use every single thing of this app without any cost

# Installation

Clone this repo and create a new directory for this app to store it's stuff. Then setup your
database anddd.d..d...d.....d......
